# Why coloring your web page?
adding color to a webpage can really bring your site to life 
### how to style colors
There are different ways you can use:
* rgb values
* hex codes
* color names

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property
sets the color of the background for that box
By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, 
so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the body element

## every color you see on a computer screen is a mix of red, green, blue
The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue just like on a television screen.

#### but still one may ask do I have to memorize each code for each color?
There are color picker tools provided by abode and w3scools
 # what does every code mean
 * RGB Values

Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
* Hex Codes

Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code
* Color Names
* Hue

Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color.
Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.
In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
* Saturation

Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. 
At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

* Brightness

Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color.
At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color.
At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.
* lightness

Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as
luminosity
# Contrast
If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font
to make it easier to read.

To check contrast there is a handy online [tool](www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html)
# OPACITY
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
# The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value #
# but adds a fourth value to  indicate opacity #
