A **growth mindset** enables one to develope basic qualities like intelligence through dedication and hardwork

It's not always easy to maintain a growth mindset when face with hard challenges, problems, or any other set of circumstances that may slow you down

So here is a few tricks and reminders reminders that keep me on track

## Growth mindset vs fixed mindset

Challange      | Growth             | Fixed
------         | -------------------|----------
too hard       | persist            | quite
others success | motivated by it    | seen as a threat
criticism      | learns from it     | ignored
