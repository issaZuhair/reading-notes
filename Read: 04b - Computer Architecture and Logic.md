# what makes a computer a computer
we as humans have always built all kind for manual labor through solving advanced mathmetical problems
it all started with the though of building a thinking machine that can
* take input
* store it
* process it
* produce output

in essence those 4 things are what make a computer a computer.
the first computers were made of wood of metal, with mechanical gears and it took til the 20th century to start using electrical components.
they used to be huge and slow, but even though they were big, it was even a bgger breakthrough.
# no matter how awesome todays computers seem they still do the same 4 tasks #
## what are thoes 4 tasks exactly 
* input:
 it includes almost everything you do as a user, typing on the keuboard, using the touch screen. any thing you tell the computer

* storage:
 memorize all the information given in the input

* process:
 the data is processes through algorithims which is a series of commands that manipulate the input to perform the required task and then sent back to the memory

* output:
the result obtained after processing 

# how do computers understand us
you must have heard about the 0-1 "language" which the binary system.
computer is made out of electric components, 1 means there is an electric current in a specific wire or part, 0 means no current.
this is used to symbolise true or false, on or off.
this single piece of wire is called a Bit which the smallest piece of information that can be stored. more wires more bits.
# Binary system.
we said the binary system is made out of ones and zeros, the normal number you know is the decimal system.
in the decimal system you use all the numbers from 0-9.
there is the ones positions, tens ...etc.
in binary in binary each position also holds a value but instead of multiplying by 10 each time you mulitply by 2.
## awesome facts:
* # with 32 wires you can store all the numbers from 1 to 4billion #
* # Text and images are also stored in ones and zeros #
* # sound is also stored in numbers #

but is the sound stored as a sequence of numbers? if you dont know sound is a wave, it has amplitude so it can be
stored in numbers. theses numbers that represent the sound wave are stored in their binary form.
## computers merge information to form output.
in the computer there a ton of circuits, these circuits have current through them like said before 1 or 0
the princple of them is simple but needs much attention, example a flip circuit.
give a 1 it gives a 0, give it a 0 and it gives you a 1.
now imagine a ton of circuits working together taking all kinds and amounts of information to process the functions. they for example represint the logic gates of the computer "Truth table".
why are todats small circuits so fast, smaller circuit means that the current travells less distance.
# CPU Central Processing Unit
as an example when you open MS word and type the letter "B" the keyboard sends this input in ones and zeros to the CPU, that start to
 calculate pixel by pixel how to draw "B" the CPU requests information from memory on how yo draw it and then stores the result in 
 memory which then outputed by the screen.
Any thing you take from a computer is an output, sounds, screen videos, 3D printers.

all the hardware associated with the computer are managed by the CPU, when recieves a pulse it activate a certain circuit inside it
and the process continues from thier
