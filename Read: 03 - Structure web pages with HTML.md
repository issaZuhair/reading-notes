# Traditional HTML Layouts

For a long time, web page authors used div  elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar).

 Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the div element in the structure of the page.

# New Html5 Layout Elements
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them.

 They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already

For example, the header sits
inside a new 
><header> element.

The navigation in a <nav>
element, and the articles are in
individual <article>
 elements

## headers and footers
* The main header or footerthat appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
* A header or footer for an individual article or section within the page.


For example, on a page with several blog posts, each individual post can be thought
of as a separate section. The header element can therefore be used to contain the title and date of each individual post, and
the <footer> might contain links to share the article on social networking sites.
## Navigation nav
 element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
## article
The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
This could be
* individual article
* blog entry
* comment
* forum post
* any other independent piece of content.

# aside
The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.
When the aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the
article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.
# When the <aside> element is used outside of an article element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page #
# section
The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

# Figures
there is two elements her 
1. figure elemenr
2. figcaption

It is important to note that the article should still make sense if the content of the figure
element were moved (to another part of the page, or even to a different page altogether).
For this reason, it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not
for something that is absolutely integral to the flow of a page)

## Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
 
## Wireframes
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the 
information and how much space it might require. You can draw on a notepad or a paint, or even a piece of paper whatever suits you
Note that you should NOT include color, font style, or any other styling choice

## do NOT mix all kind of colors or designs when making a webpage  
* Know your audience.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
