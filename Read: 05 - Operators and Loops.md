# logical operators in javascript
* equal to ==:
compares to value to see if they are the same
* strict equal to ===:
checks to see if to to values have the same type and and value
* not equal to !=
checks to value to see if they are different 
* strict not equal !==:
value and type cant be equal in this one.
* the greater than /> 
* less than \<
* greater than or equal />= 
* less than or equal \<= 
 they are all logical and and result in a true or false based on the values they are comparing.
 # and, or , not
 * and (&&) needs two true statements to result in a true
 * or (||) 
 if one statement is true the result is true
 * not (!)
 flips true to false and false to true 




# loops in javascript
loops check check a condition if its true they execute the codes in thier scope over and over 
until the condition is not met anymore, "false".
# three types of loops
* For loops:
we use them when know exactly how many times we need to run the statement
* while loops:
we dont know how many times to run, but we know that we should stop when a certain event happens
* do while:
same as while except that it will run atleast one time if the condition is false

the logic of loops is provide in the figure and as they say a picture is woth a thousand words.

# loops key concepts
1. break:
this statement is used to stop the loop even if the condition is still true.
2. continue:
skips the itteration
3. LOOPS & ARRAYS:
Loops are very helpful when dealing with arrays if you want to run the same code for each item
in the array
