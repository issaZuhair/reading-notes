# we need tot alk about HTML and CSS before diving into JAVA script
you already know what is an html element but a quick reminder never hurts anyone. Take alook at the figure below.

#### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following: > manuals, handbooks, or any other thing you follow its instructions
> scripts are step by step instructions that a computer can follow and the browser follows different parts of them to render your page.

important note  computers are litteral, every time you need it do something you have to provide a step-by-step instructions.
which are the scripts.
# how to achieve the goal or task
1. Define the task you want to achieve be as clear as you can be
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.
3. CODE EACH STEP Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter
understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

# how to define a goal and design the script
1. Detail your goals for the script
2. Break it into a series of tasks that have to be performed in order to achieve the goals:
****
1. The script is triggered when the button is clicked.
2. It collects the name entered into the form field.
3. It checks that the user has entered a value.
4. If the user has not entered anything, a message will appear telling them to enter a name.
5. If a name has been entered, calculate the cost of the sign by multiplying the number of letters by
the cost per letter.
6. Show how much the plaque costs.


# javascript makes web pages more interactive.
* Access points:
 You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
* MODIFY CONTENT:
 You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 
* PROGRAM RULES: 
 You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
* REACT TO EVENTS:
 You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

## But what are examples that we see everyday of JAVASCRIPT on the browser
* Filtering
* Reloading part of the page
* Slideshows
* Forms

# JAVASCRIPT expressions
## two types of experssions 
* assign values
* operate on value 

broadly speaking expressions results in one value.

#### ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.
STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
resulting Hi 1 + Mol ly as a single string.

here is a list of JAVASCRIPT arithmetic operators

# JAVASCRIPT functions
The fact that JAVASCRIPT allows us to define functions is crucial.
function are reuseable, help clarify the code for other developers, can be invoked as we want to and minimize repetition in the code.
### what is a function?
a function is user defined block of code, a set of instruction that takes place step by step everytime the function is called
