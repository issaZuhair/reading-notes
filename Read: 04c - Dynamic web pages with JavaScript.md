# JAVA SCRIPT
Web developers mostly work with 3 languages, html, css, java script that represent the skiliton, skin, and mind of a web page respectively
But how do you link the javascript to your html page?
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML script element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
But as a best practice you script javascript in a seperate file using your favorite text editor ex: VScode. and then linking it using 
the script tag providing the path in the src attribute.
# how to use java script 
first you need to understand that java script runs wherever its found in the html.
>When the browser comes across a script element, it stops to
load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
you should end every statement with a semicolon not all browsers are smart enough to overlook the mistake of not using them.
ex) you need to store the date in a variable.
type :
var today=new Date();
here var is a keyword indicating that today is a variable.
new Date(); is apredefined function in JS dont worry about it know all will be clear at the right time.
and give your self a pat on the back you just wrote your first JS statment.
but keep in mind JAVASCRIPT is case sensetive X<> x caps do not equal small case letters.
### statment are instructions and each one starts on a new line
### statments can organized into code blocks 
# any set of statments between curly braces {} are known as code blocks
can you collaborate with others while working JAVASCRIPT ?
JAVASCRIPT allows the ability to write comments on your file 
any thing typed after // is acoment and will never be executed, so you can clarify the code for other developers and work together
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables
A variable is a good name for this
concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 
No matter what the dimensions of any individual wall are, you know that you can find its area by
multiplying the width of that wall by its height.
Similarly, scripts often need to achieve the same goal even when they are run with different data, so variables can be used to represent values in your
scripts that are likely to change. The result is said to be calculated or computed using the data stored in
the variables. 
The use of variables to represent numbers or other kinds of data is very similar to the concept of algebra
(where le.tters are used to represent numbers). There is one key difference, however. 
The equals sign does something very different in programming
# HOW TP DECLEARE VARIABLES #
var today=new Date();
same explained before here we declared the variable today.
# DATA TYPES
* NUMERIC: any nymber
* STRINGS: any thing inside ""
* BOOLEAN: true and false
